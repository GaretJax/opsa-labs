\section{Introduction}

The goal of this laboratory session is to scan a given target (in this case, the scope is a local network segment) and find it's operational security, controls and limitations as defined by the OSSTMM.

In our case, the scope are all the hosts on the local network segment \texttt{160.98.20.46-66} and the attack vector is from any machine inside the room \texttt{C0022} (Inside Network).

\section{Visibility}

The OSSTMM defines the \textit{Visibility} as \textit{the number of targets in the scope}. In order to get the most precise view possible of the system, we an ARP scan using \texttt{nmap}. The results of the \texttt{sudo nmap -sP -PR 160.98.20.46-66} command are illustrated in the \autoref{lst:arp-scan}.

\end{lstlisting}

As shown in the command output, 9 hosts where found to be up and accessible over the local network.

\section{Access}

\textit{Access} is the number of \textit{unique interacton points, regardless of how many different ways this interaction point can be probed}. In our specific case, this is the number of open TCP or UDP ports on each host.

\texttt{nmap} makes it easy to scan different hosts at once by defining an IP address range (using the same syntax as for the previous section). The used command, in this case, are the following: \texttt{sudo nmap -sU 160.98.20.46-66} and \texttt{sudo nmap -sV -PN 160.98.20.46-66} (for UDP and TCP, respectively).

This chapter and the rest of this document is based on nmap scan results. You can find these results in annexes A and B. The \autoref{tab:report} resume scan results and interpretations.

\section{Trust}

Trust is the determination of trust relationships from and between the targets. A trust relationship exists wherever the target accepts interaction freely and without credentials.

In this scope, trust is not relevant, so we won't consider it.

\section{Class A -- Interactive Controls}

In this chapter, we explain how values of differents controls A (presented in the previous table) is obtained. 

\subsection{Autentication}

- SSH services on all hosts ask for a password\\
- Telnet service ask for a password\\
- VMWare SSL/Auth ask for a password\\
- VMWare Auth ask for a password

\subsection{Indemnification}

There is not idenmnification measures observed on discovered services.

\subsection{Resilience}

These hosts are workstation and not server. Resilience measure are not implemented in the discovered applications. This information is known because we simulate a test in which scope hosts are known (Tandem test).

\subsection{Subjugation}

There is not subjugation measures observed on discovered services.

\subsection{Continuity}

These hosts are workstation and not server. Continuity measure are not implemented in the discovered applications. This information is known because we simulate a test in which scope hosts are known (Tandem test).

%******************************************************************************%
%******************************************************************************%

\section{Class B -- Process Controls}

In this chapter, we explain how values of differents controls B (presented in the previous table) is obtained.

\subsection{Non-Repudiation}

- SSH login attempt (success \& fail) are logged in system logs\\
- VMWare SSL/Auth login attempt (success \& fail) are logged in vmware logs\\
- VMWare Auth login attempt (success \& fail) are logged in vmware logs

\subsection{Confidentility \& Authenticity \& Integrity}

- SSH communications are encrypted, authenticated and integrates\\
- VMWare SSL/Auth communications are encrypted, authenticated and integrates

\subsection{Alarm}

Linux hosts are workstation without any antivirus nor IDS. 160.98.20.46 is a windows host with an antivirus which can give alarm.

This information is known because we simulate a test in which scope hosts are known (Tandem test).

%******************************************************************************%
%******************************************************************************%

\section{Limitations}

\subsection{Vulnerabilities}

There is not vulnerability observed on discovered services.

\subsection{Weaknesses}

Version of the SSH Serveur is OpenSSH 5.6. This version have two known vulnerabilty CVE-2010-4478, CVE-2010-4478. These two vulnerability don't permit to access directly the machine, this is a weakness and not a vunerability.
