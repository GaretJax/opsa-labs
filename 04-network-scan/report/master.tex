\section{Introduction}

The goal of this laboratory session is to scan a given target (in this case, the scope is a local network segment) and find it's operational security, controls and limitations as defined by the OSSTMM.

In our case, the target are all the hosts on the local network segment \texttt{160.98.20.46-66} and the attack vector is from any machine inside the room \texttt{C0022}.

\section{Visibility and Access}

The OSSTMM defines the \textit{Visibility} as \textit{the number of targets in the scope}. In order to get the most precise view possible of the system, we an ARP scan using \texttt{nmap}. The results of the \texttt{sudo nmap -sP -PR 160.98.20.46-66} command are illustrated in the \autoref{lst:arp-scan}.

\end{lstlisting}

As shown in the command output, 9 hosts where found to be up and accessible over the local network.

\section{Access}

\textit{Access} is the number of \textit{unique interacton points, regardless of how many different ways this interaction point can be probed}. In our specific case, this is the number of open TCP or UDP ports on each host.

\texttt{nmap} makes it easy to scan different hosts at once by defining an IP address range (using the same syntax as for the previous section). The used command, in this case, are the following: \texttt{sudo nmap -sU 160.98.20.46-66} and \texttt{sudo nmap -sV -PN 160.98.20.46-66} (for UDP and TCP, respectively).
