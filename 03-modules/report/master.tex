\section{IP addresses and Autonomous Systems}

\subsection{Google's Autonomous System}

To find Google's AS (Autonomous System), it suffices to execute a whois query on an IP address belonging to google. We start thus by executing a DNS query on Google's domain in order to get an IP address, as shown in the \autoref{lst:google-ip}. Once an IP address is found, we can obtain the AS by looking at the \texttt{OriginAS} field of the related \texttt{whois} query, as illustrated in the \autoref{lst:google-as}.

\lstset{caption=,label=lst:google-ip,language=bash,numbers=none}
\begin{lstlisting}
$ dig google.com
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.		30	IN	A	173.194.35.32
...
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{caption=,label=lst:google-as,language=bash,numbers=none}
\begin{lstlisting}
$ whois 173.194.35.32
...
OriginAS:       AS15169
...
\end{lstlisting}

The result clearly states the Google's Autonomous System is \texttt{15169}. In order to speed up future \emph{AS queries}, we wrote the script in \autoref{lst:find-as} which can be used by simply passing in a domain as the first argument.

\lstinputlisting[caption=Simple script to find the AS for a given domain,label=lst:find-as,language=bash,numbers=left,escapechar=]{../find-as.sh}


\subsection{Google's IP addresses}

To find all IP addresses belonging to Google's AS, we used a public BGP router by AT\&T and executed a \texttt{show ip bgp} command by filtering the results using a regex. The complete command is shown in the \autoref{lst:show-ip}.

\lstset{caption=,label=lst:show-ip,language=bash,numbers=none}
\begin{lstlisting}
route-server>show ip bgp regex . 15169
\end{lstlisting}

The returned results show every possible route to each IP address in the AS. An excerpt of the first lines is shown in the \autoref{lst:routes}. The interesing part for us are the IP addresses indicated in the network field (highlighted in the listing).

\lstset{caption=,label=lst:routes,language=bash,numbers=none}

\end{lstlisting}

To obtain a list of all IP addresses, we created a script (see Appendix~\ref{apx:bgp-script}) to execute the request and parse the reply. Additionally, we integrated the GeoIP Lite database\footnote{Available for free at \url{http://www.maxmind.com/app/geoip_country}. This database is simply a collection of the \texttt{Country} field of a whois request for each contained IP address, imprecise results are thus expected.} in the script in order to get the location for each retrieved IP address.

The full list of found IP addresses and the relative countries is available in the Appendix~\ref{apx:ip-addresses}.


\subsection{Spanish IP address}

To find out one of Google's spanish IP address, we used the looking glass offered by RedIRIS at \url{http://www.rediris.es/red/lg/}. We used the CICA router and the \texttt{ping} method to retrieve the IP address as shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}
PING www.l.google.com (!\HighlightFrom!173.194.34.228!\HighlightTo!): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 173.194.34.228: icmp_seq=0 ttl=60 time=8.318 ms
...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Spanish \texttt{traceroute}}

Similarly as done for the previous subsection, this time we execute the \texttt{traceroute} command for the same domain. The route to Google's server is listed below:

\begin{lstlisting}
traceroute to google.com (173.194.34.228), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
 1  CICA.GE0-2-0.ciemat.rt1.mad.red.rediris.es (130.206.245.37)  7.214 ms  7.208 ms  7.117 ms

\section{Modules questions}

\subsection{Question 1}

The ROEs don't allow fear-based marketing, which is the case here. Statistics used alone can be interpreted to only highlight what we want and that's the case here.

A better solution would be to relativize and to show the benefits to the client.

\subsection{Question 2}

As before, this case doesn't respect the ROEs neither: the service can't be offered, but the client would tend to modify its environment during the test in order to get the service for free.

On the same line, this would also push the client to prefer blackbox testing only and to not grant complete (or even correct) access to the necessary assets (testing accounts, specifications,…).

\subsection{Question 4}

Responsabilities:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Inform the client about the dangers involved in the testing activities (e.g. an old machine which doesn't support the additional load caused by the testing and which subsequently crashes);
	\item Guarantee the confidentiality of the collected data.
\end{itemize}

Limits:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item The test does not guarantee an exhaustive vulnerabilities list;
	\item The results are representative of the current security level, but this level degrades with the passage of time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 5}

\begin{description}[itemsep=2mm,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
	\item{\textbf{Internet Networking:}} Firewall, efficacity depends on the configuration, well implemented.
	\item{\textbf{8.11b Wireless:}} WPA-PSK, efficacity depends on the password strength, well implemented.
	\item{\textbf{VoIP, VoiceMail and PBX:}} Proxy registration, efficacity depends on the passwords strengths, well implemented.
	\item{\textbf{SSO:}} Token, efficacity depends on the generation algorithm (RSA), used by different enterprises.
\end{description}

\subsection{Question 6}

The most prevalent method for securing these systems is \textit{Authentication}.

\subsection{Question 7}

It is the combination of \textit{Authentication}, \textit{Authorization}, \textit{Confidentiality} and \textit{Integrity}.

\subsection{Question 8}

\subsubsection{TCP}

Connection oriented OSI Level 4 transport protocol

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
	\item{\textbf{Pros:}} Port multiplexing. Reliable and ordered delivery.
	\item{\textbf{Cons:}} Resource consuming. Big overhead (headers, ACKs,…).
\end{description}

\subsubsection{UDP}

Connectionless OSI level 4 transport protocol

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
	\item{\textbf{Pros:}} Simple and efficient. Port multiplexing.
	\item{\textbf{Cons:}} Unreliable communication.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{ICMP}

OSI Level 3 management protocol

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
	\item{\textbf{Pros:}} Useful for problem resolution.
	\item{\textbf{Cons:}} Can lead to information leakage.
\end{description}

\subsection{Question 9}

The reference person defined on the contract has to be immediately alerted. Additionally, useful information may be used to suggest a way to isolate the communications of the trojan (in order to avoid the divulgation of confidential information as well as to block a possible divulgation).

\subsection{Question 10}

The test has probably one of the following two goals: to test the tester or to find an excuse to fire an employee.

In the first case, a tester can be tested because such a network will probably present different etherogeneous systems and testing everything thoroughly can be a complicated (and long) task.

In the second case, a testing of such a system will quite surely lead to the discovery of different security breaches and can subsequently be used as a reason to fire someone on the company's IT staff.
